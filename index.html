              Listed as Endangered on the basis that this species occurs in
              eight subpopulations, with a total adult population estimated to
              contain fewer than 1,400 individuals, no individual subpopulation
              contains more than 500 individuals, and climate modelling suggests
              a rate of decline over 40 years from 2010 which may exceed 30%
              (equating to a decline in excess of 20% across a two-generation
              period of 30 years), although long-term monitoring on Komodo and
              Rinca have not yet recorded any declines in occupancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the species has an area of occupancy estimated at
              809 km2, and certainly below 2,000 km2, within which it is
              considered to occur both as a severely fragmented population (as
              no more than 34% of the population is in any subpopulation, and
              rates of genetic exchange are very low) and at eight locations
              (each representing one subpopulation), and there is a continuing
              decline in the extent and quality of its habitat across a third of
              its range driven by human activities, including agricultural
              expansion.

              Nusatenggara province, sits the vast and impressive Komodo
              National Park.. The Komodo National Park encompasses a total of 29
              volcanic islands (including the 3 major islands Rinca, Padar and
              Komodo) and is home to approximately 2,500 Komodo Dragons and
